LEAP_working_notebook.ipynb

Note, the notebooks 01-04 contain all the important code for the different steps, however most ov the actual training, evaluating and test was done in the LEAP_working_notebook.ipynb and on notebooks still lying on the university cluster. For an easier overview I added notebooks 01-04.
